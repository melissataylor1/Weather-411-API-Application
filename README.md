# Description
### Why was this project significant?
"Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own."

This weeks module introduced the FullStack Flex class to Server-side APIs. This information is used for fetching data from other websites and using it in tandem with our applications. As this was the last unit before the final project of this "Phase" of the course, this project was intended to unite the skills we've covered thus far. 


### What did this project ask of us? 
The Module 6 challenge asked students to build a weather dashboard application that pulls data from OpenWeatherMap using various APIs. The information pulled is supposed to work dynamically with our CSS and HTML. The user will type in a city, and its current weather data will show up, along with a 5 day forecast below (all with matching icons). Additionally, an interactive search history pulled from local storage is also presented. 

This was my first project working with API keys in my code. This project was also the first time I chose to explore Bootstrap for styling. I found it to be much easier, especially for responsive layouts; I will continue using it in the future.
